# Plotting a chart

This is the first time I participate in a Challenge like this. This Challenge was more difficult then i thought it would be. I had a very difficulty time to get the data from the input, and, unfortunately, i couldn't do it. I generated the Chart from the json data the I hard coded. Besides, I think i learned new things from this experience.

## What I used

<p>Chart.js</p>
<p>React ace editor</p>
<p>Axios</p>

## To run the project
```
yarn install OR npm install
```
